# XMLHttpRequest.js
XMLHttpRequest is an object which is used to request data from server. It is really amazing for me as I have used it for the first time, today. We can get, send,put(editing) &amp; delete data by using XMLHttpRequest. I have discussed only how to get or send data in this repository.
